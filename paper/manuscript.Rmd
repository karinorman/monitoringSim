# Framing

Survey design is a fundamental challenge of monitoring ecological status fro conservation, management, and establishing temporal trends. Increasingly we've moved beyond the non-probaballistic/haphazard sampling based on accessiblity or expert opinion to establish sampling frameworks that explicitly consider statisticall inference from the resulting data. Still, the variety of algorithms for survey designs continue to be constrained to a few well known algorithms accessible through R pakcages. Survey design is a challenge for a variety of fields, and development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms is on going. This development presents a significant opportunity for Ecology to expand its toolbox for survey design. Still, the lack of application of algorithms from outside ecology means we do not have good intuition for algorithm selection, and the scenarios for which different algorithms may be most suitable, considering factors such as scale, heterogeneity, sample size, and target variables (e.g. what you want to sample).

Common algorithms for survey design are simple random sampling ,stratified sampling, GRTS. We found x papers citing each of these. A whole bunch of other algorithms outlined by [Benedetti2017; Benedetti 2015; Kermorvant 2019].
