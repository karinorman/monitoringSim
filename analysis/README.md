## General Project Thoughts:

#### Things still to implement:

-   look at how inflection points compare between algorithms - who reaches "saturation" first?

-   where are the trade offs between metrics? Discuss how that may play into the values dimension of designing a network - what kinds of scenarios prioritize different kinds of networks?

    -   what is the ecologically meaning of a higher or lower metric? (what is the intuition, do these degrees of difference even matter; what's the min number of sites necessary to meet those ecological goals)

-   Additional taxa - perform differently for different taxa (especially thinking about operational scale for taxa of different sizes)

#### Potential other directions:

-   adding in cost restrictions and evaluating performance

-   thinking about the scenario where you might lose sites at random due to logistical restrictions - which networks are most robust to those losses?

-   Moving window across the landscape - how do they perform at different levels of heterogeneity? Or different scales?

-   what happens if you add species richness as an input

-   if you design a network n = 50, then can only sample n = 20, is that better or worse than just designing n = 20 to begin with

-   structured decision making - what if we give someone a suite of designs and they pick based on values
